## Design Tasks

### Priority 1: Starter Selection Implementation
**Task**: Implement the intro sequence and starter train selection

**Requirements**:
- Show IntroScene dialogue from Professor Cypress (intro.js)
- Display StarterSelection UI with 3 choices (Chuglet, Voltrail, Oilpup)
- Allow player to navigate with arrow keys or touch
- Confirm selection with A button
- Add chosen starter to player's party
- Set `player.hasStarterTrain = true`
- Transition to overworld

**Technical Approach**:
1. Add `CONSTANTS.STATES.INTRO` and `CONSTANTS.STATES.STARTER_SELECTION`
2. Create `renderIntro()` method in Game class
3. Create `renderStarterSelection()` method with 3 train sprites
4. Handle input in `updateIntro()` and `updateStarterSelection()`
5. Create Train instance of selected species at level 5
6. Transition to OVERWORLD state after selection

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Intro dialogue advances with A button
- Starter selection shows 3 trains with descriptions
- Selection highlights chosen train
- Confirm adds train to party
- Game transitions smoothly to overworld
- Save/load preserves `hasStarterTrain` flag

**Deliverable**: Implemented intro and starter selection, tested and integrated

---

### Priority 2: Remaining Town Maps
**Task**: Implement the 4 remaining towns

**Towns to Create**:
1. **Steamspring Village** (Gym 3 - Steam type)
2. **Diesel Den** (Gym 4 - Diesel type)
3. **Maglev Heights** (Gym 5 - Maglev type)
4. **Nuclear Station** (Gym 7 - Nuclear type)
5. **Monorail Mountaintop** (Gym 8 - Monorail type)

**For Each Town**:
- Create `createTownName()` function in world-maps.js
- Define map size (appropriate to town size)
- Use tile types from TILE_TYPES (GRASS, PATH, BUILDING, STATION, etc.)
- Place gym leader NPC with badge and party
- Add 2-3 casual NPCs with dialogue
- Add map connections (routes in/out)
- Define encounter tables for nearby routes

**Technical Notes**:
- Follow existing pattern from `createPistonTown()`, `createCoalHarbor()`
- Gym leaders use `type: 'gym_leader'` and `badge: 'Badge Name'`
- NPCs use `{ id, name, x, y, type, color, dialogue }`
- Maps added to `createAllMaps()` return object

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 5 towns implemented with proper tile layouts
- Gym leaders have parties matching difficulty curve (from Game Design Agent)
- NPCs have dialogue (from Worldbuilding Agent)
- Player can walk around towns without collision issues
- Map connections work correctly

**Deliverable**: 4 new town maps implemented and tested

---

### Priority 3: Evolution System
**Task**: Implement level-based evolution

**Requirements**:
- After battle, check if any party trains reached evolution level
- Show evolution sequence (animation optional)
- Display "[Train] is evolving!" message
- Allow player to cancel with B button
- If confirmed, transform Train into evolved species
- Preserve HP percentage, moves, and other stats
- Update train sprite

**Technical Approach**:
1. In Battle class, after battle ends, check `train.checkForEvolution()`
2. Add `checkForEvolution()` method to Train class:
   ```javascript
   checkForEvolution() {
       const species = SPECIES_DATA[this.speciesId];
       if (species.evolvesTo && this.level >= species.evolvesAtLevel) {
           return species.evolvesTo; // Returns evolved species ID
       }
       return null;
   }
   ```
3. In Game class, add `CONSTANTS.STATES.EVOLUTION`
4. Show evolution dialogue and confirmation
5. Apply evolution: `train.evolve(newSpeciesId)`
6. Train.evolve() updates speciesId, recalculates stats, keeps HP percentage

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Evolution triggers at correct level
- Player can cancel evolution
- Evolved train has correct stats
- HP percentage is preserved
- Moves are retained
- Save/load works with evolved trains

**Deliverable**: Evolution system implemented and tested

---

### Priority 4: Enhanced Train Sprites
**Task**: Implement detailed train sprites per Art Direction specs

**Requirements**:
- Update `drawEnhancedTrainSprite()` in graphics.js
- Use Art Direction Agent's color palettes
- Add type-specific visual details:
  - STEAM: Smokestack, animated smoke puff
  - ELECTRIC: Pantograph, glowing elements
  - DIESEL: Boxy, exhaust pipes
  - MAGLEV: No wheels, magnetic glow
  - FREIGHT: Cargo cars visible
  - PASSENGER: Windows, colorful
  - NUCLEAR: Radiation symbol, glowing core
  - MONORAIL: Single rail underneath
- Maintain 48x48 pixel size
- Use muted, painterly colors

**Technical Approach**:
1. Create color palette constants for each type
2. Update `drawEnhancedTrainSprite()` to use species-specific colors
3. Add detail rendering (smokestacks, pantographs, etc.) based on type
4. Implement simple animations (smoke puff, wheel rotation) as 2-frame cycles
5. Cache sprites to canvas for performance (optional)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 151 train sprites have type-specific details
- Colors match Art Direction Agent's palette
- Sprites are visually distinct
- Performance remains at 60fps
- Sprites look good on mobile

**Deliverable**: Enhanced sprite rendering system

---

### Priority 5: Battle Animations
**Task**: Add polish to battle system with simple animations

**Animations Needed**:
1. **Train Entry**: Slide in from side (300ms ease-out)
2. **Move Selection**: Highlight selected move
3. **Attack**: Attacker sprite flashes or moves forward (200ms)
4. **Damage**: Defender sprite shakes (150ms)
5. **Faint**: Defender fades out (500ms)
6. **HP Bar**: Animate HP decrease smoothly (not instant)

**Technical Approach**:
- Add animation state to Battle class
- Use timer to track animation progress
- Interpolate sprite positions/opacity during animations
- Queue animations (don't overlap)
- Add `isAnimating` flag to prevent input during animations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Animations are smooth (60fps maintained)
- Animations can't be skipped accidentally
- HP bars animate smoothly
- Faint animation is clear
- Battles feel more polished

**Deliverable**: Battle animation system

---

## Code Quality Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Classes: PascalCase (`Train`, `Battle`, `WorldMap`)
- Functions/methods: camelCase (`checkForEncounter`, `drawPlayer`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`TILE_TYPES`, `MAX_PARTY_SIZE`)
- Private methods: prefix with `_` (`_calculateDamage`)

### Code Structure
```javascript
class ExampleClass {
    constructor(params) {
        // Properties
        this.publicProperty = value;
        this._privateProperty = value;
    }

    // Public methods
    publicMethod() {
        // Implementation
    }

    // Private methods
    _privateMethod() {
        // Implementation
    }

    // Static methods
    static staticMethod() {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Comments
```javascript
/**
 * Calculate damage using Gen 1 Pokemon formula
 * @param {Train} attacker - The attacking train
 * @param {Train} defender - The defending train
 * @param {Move} move - The move being used
 * @returns {number} Damage dealt
 */
function calculateDamage(attacker, defender, move) {
    // Base damage calculation
    const level = attacker.level;
    const power = move.power;
    const attack = attacker.stats.attack;
    const defense = defender.stats.defense;

    // Gen 1 formula: ((2 * Level / 5 + 2) * Power * (Attack / Defense) / 50 + 2)
    const baseDamage = Math.floor(
        ((2 * level / 5 + 2) * power * (attack / defense) / 50 + 2)
    );

    // Apply type effectiveness
    const effectiveness = getTypeEffectiveness(move.type, defender.types);

    // Random factor (0.85 - 1.0)
    const randomFactor = 0.85 + Math.random() * 0.15;

    return Math.floor(baseDamage * effectiveness * randomFactor);
}
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
// Good: Defensive programming
function getTile(x, y) {
    if (x < 0 || x >= this.width || y < 0 || y >= this.height) {
        return TILE_TYPES.VOID; // Safe default
    }
    return this.tiles[y][x];
}

// Bad: Assumes valid input
function getTile(x, y) {
    return this.tiles[y][x]; // Can crash if out of bounds
}
```

## Performance Guidelines

### Rendering Optimization
- Only render visible tiles (camera viewport)
- Cache sprites to offscreen canvas when possible
- Minimize canvas state changes (fillStyle, strokeStyle)
- Batch similar draw calls together

### Memory Management
- Clear unused references
- Avoid creating new objects in update loop
- Reuse objects when possible
- Profile memory usage regularly

### Mobile Optimization
- Test on actual mobile devices
- Minimize touch event listeners
- Optimize sprite sizes
- Reduce particle effects if FPS drops

- **Performance issues**: Profile with browser DevTools, check draw call count

### Browser DevTools
- Use `console.log()` liberally during development
- Use `debugger;` to set breakpoints
- Profile performance with Performance tab
- Check memory leaks with Memory tab
