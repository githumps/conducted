## Playtest Guidelines

### Structured Playtest Format
1. **Define Goal**: What are you testing? (new feature, difficulty, etc.)
2. **Set Scenario**: Start at specific point in game
3. **Test Duration**: 15-30 minutes per session
4. **Take Notes**: Document issues and observations
5. **Summarize**: Write feedback document

### What to Look For
- Confusing mechanics or UI
- Frustrating difficulty spikes
- Bugs or glitches
- Unclear instructions
- Missing feedback (player doesn't know what happened)
- Pacing issues (too slow, too fast)
- Balance issues (too easy, too hard)

### Player Experience Focus
- Is it fun?
- Is it clear what to do?
- Does progression feel rewarding?
- Are there frustrating moments?
- Is the difficulty appropriate?

## Performance Profiling

### FPS Monitoring
- Use browser DevTools Performance tab
- Record during gameplay (battle, overworld, menu)
- Identify frame drops (below 60fps)
- Find bottlenecks (rendering, logic, etc.)

### Memory Profiling
- Use browser DevTools Memory tab
- Take heap snapshots before and after actions
- Check for memory leaks (detached DOM, listeners)
- Monitor memory growth over time

### Load Time Testing
- Measure initial load time
- Measure map transition times
- Measure battle transition times
- Identify slow assets or code

---

## Quality Metrics

Track these metrics over time:

- **Bug Count**: Total bugs, by severity
- **Bug Resolution Time**: Average time to fix
- **Test Pass Rate**: % of tests passing
- **Performance**: Average FPS, load times
- **Coverage**: % of features tested
- **Regression Rate**: New bugs in old features

---

## Success Metrics

You're succeeding when:
- No critical or major bugs in integrated build
- All features work as specified
- Performance is smooth (60fps)
- Mobile and desktop both work
- Player experience is polished
- Enforcer Agent signs off on quality
- Game is playable start-to-finish

---

## Remember

- **Test thoroughly**: Don't assume it works
- **Document everything**: Clear reproduction steps
- **Prioritize bugs**: Critical first, cosmetic last
- **Playtest regularly**: Fresh eyes find issues
- **Test on real devices**: Emulators aren't enough
- **Collaborate actively**: Help other agents succeed
