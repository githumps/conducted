### 2. Sound Effect Specifications
- Define sound effects for all player actions
- Specify battle sound effects (moves, damage, faint)
- Design UI sound effects (menu navigation, button presses)
- Create ambient sound specifications
- Define train vocalization/sound signatures

### 3. Audio System Design
- Design audio mixing and volume levels
- Create adaptive music system (changes based on gameplay)

### 2. Honor Pokemon Gen 1 Audio
Reference Pokemon Red/Blue audio design:
- Simple, catchy melodies
- Limited instrumentation (chiptune-inspired)
- Distinct themes for each town
- Iconic battle music
- Memorable sound effects

### 3. Mobile-Friendly

- Optional audio (players can mute easily)
- Minimal battery drain

### 4. Accessibility
- Audio is optional, not required
- Visual alternatives for important audio cues
- Volume controls are accessible
- No sound-based puzzles

- Legendary battle theme starts

**Victory Road**:
- Music should be most intense of all routes
- Suggests final challenge approaching

**Elite Four / Champion**:
- Each Elite Four member has unique battle music variant
- Champion battle has most epic music in game

**Deliverable**: Adaptive music system design document

### Priority 5: Audio Technical Specifications
**Task**: Define technical requirements for audio implementation

**File Formats**:
- **Music**: MP3 (for compatibility) and OGG (for quality/size)
- **Sound Effects**: MP3 or OGG, short files
- **Browser Support**: Fallback to MP3 if OGG not supported

**Sample Rates**:
- Music: 44.1 kHz (CD quality)
- Sound Effects: 22.05 kHz (smaller files, sufficient quality)

**Bit Depth**:
- 16-bit for all audio (standard)

**File Size Targets**:
- Each music track: < 1 MB (compressed)
- Each sound effect: < 50 KB
- Total audio budget: < 20 MB (for initial load)

**Loading Strategy**:
- Preload: UI sounds, battle music, common sound effects
- Lazy Load: Town music (load when entering town)
- Cache: Keep recently played music in memory

**Volume Levels** (relative, 0-100):
- Master: 80 (default)
- Music: 60 (default, relative to master)
- Sound Effects: 80 (default, relative to master)
- UI Sounds: 70 (default, relative to master)

**Mixing Priorities** (what plays when multiple sounds trigger):
1. Dialogue/Important Sounds (always play)
2. UI Sounds (interrupt less important SFX)
3. Battle SFX (can overlap)
4. Music (can be ducked if needed)

**Fade Timing**:
- Music fade out: 500ms
- Music fade in: 500ms
- Cross-fade: 1000ms (both fading simultaneously)

**Mobile Considerations**:
- Audio auto-plays may be blocked (need user interaction first)
- Provide visual "tap to enable audio" prompt
- Mute button easily accessible
- Reduce audio quality on low-end devices if needed

**Deliverable**: Audio technical specification document
