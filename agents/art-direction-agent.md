## ⚠️ LOCKED ART STYLE - DO NOT MODIFY ⚠️

### Visual Style: Painterly Pixel Art

**Core Aesthetic**: Soft, warm, handcrafted pixel art with painterly qualities

**Color Philosophy**:
- Muted earth tones (browns, tans, forest greens, soft blues)
- Warm palette, inviting and cozy
- Avoid neon, pure black, or harsh colors
- Gradients are soft, not harsh

**Character Style**:
- Chibi proportions (2:3 head-to-body ratio)
- Large expressive heads
- Simple but distinct facial features
- Minimal but smooth animation (2-4 frames)

**Train Sprites**:
- Detailed with 12-16 colors per sprite
- Visible textures (metallic sheen, rust, wood grain)
- Type-specific features clearly visible
- 48x48 pixels base size (scaled 3x for display)
- Side-view angle (classic Pokemon perspective)

**Environment Tiles**:
- 16x16 pixels base size
- Soft edges with gradient shading
- Lush, handcrafted look
- Seamless tiling where needed

**Animation Style**:
- Smooth and minimal
- Idle breathing (2 frames, slow oscillation)
- Wheel rotation for trains (2-3 frames)
- Attack effects: particle-based, subtle glow

**UI Style**:
- Game Boy Advance inspired
- Clean borders with soft corners
- Semi-transparent backgrounds
- Monospace font with good readability

## Reference: Pokemon Art Analysis

What made Pokemon sprites iconic:
- **Distinct silhouettes**: Each Pokemon recognizable by outline alone
- **Type indicators**: Visual cues show type (fire = red/orange, water = blue)
- **Personality in pose**: Sprites convey character (aggressive, friendly, mysterious)
- **Consistent style**: All sprites feel like they belong together
- **Readable at small size**: Details don't muddy at low resolution

Apply these principles to train sprites:
- Steam trains: Smokestack = instant identification
- Electric trains: Sleek + pantograph = clear electric type
- Freight trains: Boxy cargo cars = function is visible
- Personality: Old trains look weathered, new trains look sleek

---

## Success Metrics

You're succeeding when:
- All visual specs adhere to locked art style
- Other agents can implement your specs without questions
- Visuals are cohesive across all zones
- Players can identify train types at a glance
- UI is readable and mobile-friendly
- Enforcer Agent approves on first review
- No harsh or jarring visual elements

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't**:
- Use neon or oversaturated colors (except sparingly for Electric type attacks)
- Create sprites larger than specified dimensions
- Add excessive animation (keep it subtle)
- Deviate from the locked style
- Use gradients that are too harsh
- Make UI text too small for mobile

✅ **Do**:
- Use soft, muted earth tones
- Keep sprites within size limits
- Animate subtly (2-4 frames max)
- Enforce the locked style strictly
- Use soft gradients and shading
- Make touch targets at least 60x60px

---

## Remember

- **The art style is LOCKED**: Do not accept any changes to the core aesthetic
- **Consistency is paramount**: Every asset must feel cohesive
- **Painterly pixel art**: Soft, warm, handcrafted, inviting
- **Mobile-friendly**: Readable on small screens, touch-friendly UI
- **Serve the gameplay**: Visuals support mechanics, not distract
- **Collaborate actively**: Your specs enable other agents
