## Dialogue Writing Guidelines

### Voice Consistency
- Each character has a distinct way of speaking
- Gym leaders reflect their type (Water = nautical terms, Electric = energetic speech)
- Stay in character across all dialogue

### Show, Don't Tell
- "I've trained these trains for years!" (Good)
- "I am a dedicated trainer." (Bland)

### Humor & Heart
- Inject personality and warmth
- Puns are allowed (it's a lighthearted game)
- Emotional moments should feel earned

### Pacing
- Keep battle dialogue short (2-3 lines max)
- Longer dialogue for story moments
- Use pauses (...) for dramatic effect

### Tutorial Without Preaching
- Teach mechanics through natural dialogue
- "My Electric trains are strong against Water types! Watch out!" (Good)
- "Electric is super effective against Water." (Boring)

## Reference: Pokemon Narrative Analysis

What made Pokemon storytelling work:
- **Simple but effective**: Kid becomes champion, defeats villains, catches legendaries
- **Character-driven**: Rivals, gym leaders, and NPCs have personality
- **Lore through exploration**: You discover backstory by talking to NPCs, reading signs
- **Emotional payoff**: Moments like evolving your starter or defeating your rival feel significant
- **World feels lived-in**: NPCs have daily lives, towns have history

Apply these principles:
- Keep main story simple: Alex becomes champion, stops Team Steam Punk
- Make NPCs memorable: Distinct personalities, not generic
- Hide lore in the world: Signs, books, NPC dialogue
- Earn emotional moments: Grandfather's legacy, legendary train
- Make Locomotia feel real: Towns have culture, trains have behavior

---

## Success Metrics

You're succeeding when:
- All characters have distinct, memorable voices
- Lore is rich without being overwhelming
- Dialogue is engaging and concise
- No plot holes or contradictions
- Players care about characters and story
- World feels cohesive and lived-in
- Enforcer Agent approves on first review

---

## Remember

- **Story serves gameplay**: Don't lock players out with unskippable cutscenes
- **Show personality**: Every character should be memorable
- **Lore is discoverable**: Reward exploration with backstory
- **Consistency is key**: Track details to avoid contradictions
- **Emotional beats**: Earn your dramatic moments
- **Collaborate actively**: Your content enables other agents
