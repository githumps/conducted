## Understanding the System

### The Five Agents

Think of them as specialist engineers on your team:

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  üéØ Enforcer PM                                      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - Triages requests into GitHub issues              ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - Assigns work to specialists                      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - Prevents scope creep                            ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - Only loads: roadmap + issue list (no code!)     ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
         ‚îÇ
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí ‚öîÔ∏è Gameplay Engineer (battle, XP, items, money)
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí üó∫Ô∏è World Engineer (maps, doors, collision)
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí üé® UI Engineer (menus, HUD, mobile controls)
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí üß™ QA Engineer (tests, bugs, CI)
```

**Key Point**: Each specialist ONLY loads their domain files. This keeps context under 2-3k tokens.

### The Context Budget System

```
Total Budget: 8,000 tokens per turn
‚îú‚îÄ System Prompt: ~1,200 tokens (.claude/CLAUDE.md)
‚îú‚îÄ Agent Context: ~800 tokens (specialist files only)
‚îú‚îÄ Conversation: ~2,000 tokens (your messages + responses)
‚îú‚îÄ File Snippets: ~2,000 tokens (max 30 lines at a time)
‚îî‚îÄ Safety Buffer: ~2,000 tokens (for reasoning)
```

**What Happens When You Exceed Budget:**
- 1,800 tokens: Hook auto-dumps to TASKLOG.md + creates issue
- 8,000 tokens: Emergency halt, forces fresh start

### The Automation Hooks

Hooks run automatically when certain thresholds are hit:

| Hook | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `on-long-response` | >1,800 tokens | Dump to TASKLOG.md, create summary issue |
| `on-large-diff` | >150 lines changed | Block PR, force split |
| `on-missing-tests` | Core file modified without tests | Create test scaffold + issue |
| `on-build-fail` | CI fails | Auto-create bug issue with logs |
| `on-context-overflow` | >8,000 tokens | Emergency dump + halt |

**You don't need to think about these** - they enforce discipline automatically.

## Starting Your First Session

### Session Workflow

```
1. Open Claude Code in /Users/evan/Documents/GitHub/conducted
2. Say: "Load Enforcer PM agent and run /status"
3. Review the status output
4. Say: "I want to work on #52" (or whatever issue)
5. Claude assigns you to the right specialist agent
6. Follow the agent's plan ‚Üí code ‚Üí test ‚Üí commit
7. Run /ship before merging
```

### Example Session Transcript

```
You: Load Enforcer PM and run /status

Claude (as Enforcer PM):
## CONDUCTED Project Status
**Milestone 1**: 4/18 issues (22%)
**Critical Path**: #52 (map transitions) [BLOCKING]
**Recommended**: Work on #52 with World Engineer

You: Assign me to #52

Claude (as Enforcer PM):
## Triage Summary
- **Issue**: #52 - Fix map transitions (door entry/exit broken)
- **Agent**: World Engineer
- **Context**: js/world-maps.js, js/game.js (lines 284-300)
- **Estimated**: 1-2 hours

Switching to World Engineer agent now...

Claude (as World Engineer):
## Goal
Fix door transition coordinates so buildings are enterable.

## Plan
1. Read js/world-maps.js to find door placements
2. Read js/game.js lines 284-300 (checkForDoor function)
3. Verify coordinates match
4. Fix mismatches
5. Test: walk to Lab door, press action, should enter

Ready to proceed? (yes/no)

You: Yes

Claude (as World Engineer):
[Reads only the specific files/lines mentioned]
[Posts minimal diff showing the fix]
[Creates test plan]

Done! Run `/test-game` to verify doors work.
```

**Notice**:
- PM agent handed off to World Engineer
- Only relevant files were loaded
- Conversation stayed focused and short
- Total tokens: ~3,500 (well under budget!)

---

## Using Agents Effectively

### When to Use Each Agent

| You Want To... | Use This Agent |
|----------------|----------------|
| Plan work, triage bugs, check status | **Enforcer PM** |
| Fix battles, add items, implement XP/money | **Gameplay Engineer** |
| Create maps, fix doors, add encounters | **World Engineer** |
| Build menus, fix mobile controls, add HUD | **UI Engineer** |
| Write tests, fix bugs, verify quality | **QA Engineer** |

### How to Switch Agents

**Option 1: Let PM Handle It**
```
You: Load Enforcer PM. I want to add a shop system.

Claude (PM): This requires:
- Money system (#53) ‚Üí Gameplay Engineer
- Shop UI (#24) ‚Üí UI Engineer
I'll create sub-issues and assign them. Start with #53?
```

**Option 2: Direct Switch**
```
You: Switch to Gameplay Engineer. Work on #53 (money system).

Claude (Gameplay): Reading issue #53...
[Proceeds with plan]
```

### Agent Handoff Protocol

Agents will refuse work outside their domain:

```
You: (to World Engineer) Add item usage in battles

Claude (World Engineer):
‚ùå Out of scope for World Engineer.
This is a Gameplay Engineer task.

I'm creating issue #X and assigning to Gameplay Engineer.
Please switch agents.
```

**This is intentional!** It keeps each agent's context lean.

---

## How Hooks Work

### Hook 1: Long Response (>1,800 tokens)

**Trigger**: Claude's response exceeds 1,800 tokens

**What Happens**:
1. Response is auto-summarized (200 tokens max)
2. Full text appended to `DOCS/TASKLOG.md` with timestamp
3. GitHub issue created with [summary] label
4. Claude continues normally

**You See**:
```
[Auto-saved to TASKLOG.md: 2025-10-30 14:35:22]
Created issue #X for full details.
```

### Hook 2: Large Diff (>150 lines)

**Trigger**: You try to change more than 150 lines in one PR

**What Happens**:
1. PR is blocked
2. GitHub issue created with split plan
3. Claude suggests breaking into 3 smaller PRs

**You See**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Diff too large (247 lines). Created issue #X with split plan.

Recommended Parts:
1. #X-part1: Core battle logic (50 lines)
2. #X-part2: UI updates (45 lines)
3. #X-part3: Tests (60 lines)

Start with Part 1?
```

### Hook 3: Missing Tests

**Trigger**: You modify `js/battle.js`, `js/game.js`, `js/player.js`, or `js/train.js` without tests

**What Happens**:
1. Test scaffold created in `tests/[filename].test.js`
2. GitHub issue created to fill in test cases

**You See**:
```
Created test scaffold: tests/battle.test.js
Created issue #X to add test coverage.
```

### Hook 4: Build Fail

**Trigger**: CI/CD build fails

**What Happens**:
1. Error logs captured
2. GitHub issue auto-created with P1-high label
3. Repro steps included

**You See** (in GitHub):
```
Issue #X: [Bug] Build Failed: npm run lint
Labels: bug, ci, P1-high

## Error Log
```
ESLint found 3 errors:
  js/game.js:142 - Unexpected console.log
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix lint errors
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook to prevent recurrence
```

### Hook 5: Context Overflow (>8,000 tokens)

**Trigger**: Total context exceeds 8k tokens

**What Happens**:
1. Emergency dump to TASKLOG.md with full summary
2. GitHub issue created with conversation snapshot
3. **Chat halts immediately**
4. You must start fresh

**You See**:
```
üö® CONTEXT OVERFLOW (8,247 tokens)

Dumped to: DOCS/TASKLOG.md [2025-10-30 14:45:00]
Created: Issue #X for context recovery

Please:
1. Close this chat
2. Start fresh with Enforcer PM
3. Say: "Continue from issue #X"
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ

1. **Always start with Enforcer PM** - Let them triage and assign
2. **One issue at a time** - Finish before starting next
3. **Use slash commands** - They're fast and keep context lean
4. **Trust the hooks** - They'll save you from yourself
5. **Read DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md** - Understand the 6 milestones
6. **Test on mobile** - Game has touch controls, always verify
7. **Commit small PRs** - 50-150 lines is perfect
8. **Reference issues** - Always use #N notation
9. **Trust agent specialization** - Don't fight handoffs
10. **Check `/context-check`** - If session feels slow

### DON'T ‚ùå

1. **Don't paste entire files** - Use line ranges only
2. **Don't load multiple agents** - One specialist at a time
3. **Don't skip GitHub issues** - Memory must be in issues
4. **Don't change train stats** - 151 trains are balanced
5. **Don't break saves** - localStorage schema is sacred
6. **Don't ignore hooks** - They enforce best practices
7. **Don't work on 3+ issues in one session** - Context will explode
8. **Don't commit without testing mobile** - Touch controls matter
9. **Don't merge red builds** - CI must be green
10. **Don't fight the 150-line limit** - Split is better

### Efficiency Tips

**Tip 1: Use Issue Numbers Everywhere**
```
‚ùå "I want to add a shop where you can buy potions"
‚úÖ "I want to work on #24 (Rail Mart shop)"
```

**Tip 2: Let Agents Guide You**
```
‚ùå "Here's my plan for 5 features in one PR..."
‚úÖ "What's the recommended order for Milestone 1 critical path?"
```

**Tip 3: Run `/context-check` Every 4-5 Turns**
```
You: [After long discussion] /context-check

Claude: ‚ö†Ô∏è At 7,200 tokens (90% full).
Recommend: Summarize to TASKLOG and restart.
```

**Tip 4: Test Early, Test Often**
```
After every 50 lines of code: /test-game
Before every merge: /ship
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Agent Refuses to Load Files

```
You: Show me all of js/game.js

Claude: ‚ùå Cannot load entire file (935 lines).
Exceeds context budget.

Please specify line range:
fs.read("js/game.js", start_line=284, end_line=300)
```

**Solution**: Always use line ranges. If you need more context, load multiple small ranges.

### Problem: Context Overflow Warning

```
Claude: ‚ö†Ô∏è Approaching 8k token limit (7,500 tokens used)
```

**Solution**:
1. Run `/context-check` to see breakdown
2. Summarize current work to TASKLOG.md
3. Create GitHub issue with progress
4. Close chat, start fresh with PM
5. Reference the new issue

### Problem: Hook Blocked My PR

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Diff too large (200 lines). Created #X to split.
```

**Solution**:
1. Review the split plan in issue #X
2. Create branch for Part 1 only
3. Commit Part 1 (now <150 lines)
4. Merge Part 1
5. Repeat for Parts 2 and 3

This is **by design** - small PRs are safer and easier to review.

### Problem: Agent Hands Off to Another Agent

```
Claude (UI Engineer): This requires battle logic changes.
Out of my scope. Creating #X for Gameplay Engineer.
```

**Solution**:
1. Accept the handoff (it's intentional!)
2. Switch agents: "Load Gameplay Engineer, work on #X"
3. Agent specialization keeps context lean

### Problem: CI Build Failing

```
GitHub: ‚ùå Deploy to Pages failed
```

**Solution**:
1. Check if `on-build-fail` hook created an issue
2. If yes: Read issue #X for error logs
3. If no: Manually run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` locally
4. Fix errors, commit, push

### Problem: Can't Find a File

```
You: Where is the money system implemented?

Claude: Searching for "money"...
‚ùå No matches found in js/ directory.
```

**Solution**: Money system doesn't exist yet! Check DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md:
- #53 (P1-high) - Implement money/currency system [TODO]

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Skills (For Experts)

You can add game-specific skills to `.claude/skills/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "game.debug_battle",
  "description": "Run a battle with verbose logging",
  "parameters": {
    "train1": "string",
    "train2": "string",
    "log_level": "debug | info | warn"
  }
}
```

Then use it:
```
You: Run game.debug_battle with Steamini vs Steamore at debug level

Claude: Running deterministic battle...
[Detailed turn-by-turn log]
```

### Custom Hooks (For Experts)

Add to `.claude/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "on-save-schema-change",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "file_write",
    "pattern": "js/player.js",
    "condition": "localStorage_schema_modified"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "warn",
      "message": "‚ö†Ô∏è Save schema changed! Add migration code to prevent corrupted saves."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Creating New Agents (For Experts)

Create `.claude/agents/audio-engineer.md`:

```markdown
# Audio Engineer Agent

**Role**: Music, SFX, Audio Manager

**Responsibilities**:
- Integrate Web Audio API
- Implement music tracks
- Add SFX for battles, menus, encounters
- Volume controls

**Context Loaded**:
- js/audio.js (when it exists)
- Issue #35, #36 only
```

## The System in Action: Full Example

### Scenario: Add Item Usage in Battles

```
Session Start
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

You: Load Enforcer PM and run /status

Claude (PM):
## Status
**Critical**: #52 (map transitions) [BLOCKING]
**Next**: #51 (item system), #53 (money)

You: I want to work on #26 (battle item usage)

Claude (PM):
‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #26 depends on #51 (item system).
#51 is not complete yet.

Recommended order:
1. #51 (item system) - Gameplay Engineer
2. #26 (battle item usage) - Gameplay Engineer

Start with #51?

You: Yes, assign me to #51

Claude (PM):
## Triage
- **Issue**: #51 - Implement item system
- **Agent**: Gameplay Engineer
- **Blocks**: #26, #24, #23
- **Estimated**: 3-4 hours

Switching to Gameplay Engineer...

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

Claude (Gameplay):
## Goal
Implement core item system: data structure, inventory, item usage.

## Plan
1. Create js/items.js with item database
2. Add inventory to player.js (bag, item counts)
3. Implement useItem() function
4. Add item effects (restore HP, etc.)
5. Update save/load schema
6. Write tests

## Files
- js/items.js (NEW, ~80 lines)
- js/player.js (lines 50-100, add inventory)
- js/train.js (lines 80-90, add healing function)

## Risks
- Save schema change - need migration code
- Party UI will need update (out of scope, create issue)

Ready? (yes/no)

You: Yes

[Gameplay Engineer creates files with minimal diffs]
[Tests with game.test_battle skill]
[Verifies save/load works]

Claude (Gameplay):
‚úÖ Item system implemented!

Changes:
- js/items.js (78 lines) - Item database
- js/player.js (42 lines changed) - Inventory
- js/train.js (8 lines changed) - Healing
- Tests: tests/items.test.js (scaffold created)

Total diff: 128 lines (under 150 limit ‚úì)

Next steps:
- [ ] Fill in tests/items.test.js (#X created)
- [ ] Update Party UI to show items (#Y created)
- [ ] Implement #26 (battle item usage)

Run /ship before merging.

You: /ship

Claude (Gameplay):
## Pre-Merge Checklist
‚úÖ <150 lines (128)
‚úÖ No console.log found
‚úÖ Game boots without errors
‚úÖ Save/load tested
‚úÖ Mobile controls work
‚ö†Ô∏è Tests scaffolded but not complete

Recommendation: Merge now, fill tests in issue #X

You: Create PR for #51

Claude (Gameplay):
Created PR #60: "Implement core item system (Fixes #51)"

Description:
- Item database with potions, trainballs, etc.
- Player inventory management
- Item usage and effects
- Save schema updated with migration
- Tests scaffolded in #X

Ready to merge once approved!

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Session End (45 minutes, ~4,200 tokens used)
```

**What Made This Efficient**:
- PM triaged and assigned correctly
- Gameplay Engineer only loaded relevant files
- Changes stayed under 150 lines
- Tests deferred to separate issue (smart split!)
- Hooks didn't trigger (clean, disciplined work)
- Context stayed under 5k tokens

---

## Conclusion
