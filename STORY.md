# Train Battle RPG - Story & World Design

## The Legend of the Iron Rails

### Backstory

In the world of **Locomotia**, trains are not mere machinesâ€”they are living beings born from the essence of the ancient Rails of Power. Long ago, the legendary **Conductor Prime** discovered that certain railway tracks possessed mystical energy, and trains that traveled these rails gained consciousness and extraordinary abilities.

Over centuries, humans learned to bond with these sentient trains, becoming **Train Conductors**â€”trainers who raise, battle, and care for their train companions. The greatest Conductors are honored with **Rail Badges** and eventually challenge the **Elite Four Conductors** and the **Grand Station Master** for the title of **Champion Conductor**.

### Your Journey

You are **Alex** (player can choose name), a young aspiring Conductor from **Piston Town**, a small village built around an old steam depot. Your late grandfather was a legendary Conductor who traveled the world with his powerful train, **Old Iron**, a mystical steam locomotive said to have saved Locomotia from the Great Derailment decades ago.

On your 16th birthday, **Professor Cypress** (the region's train researcher) asks you to visit his laboratory. He's discovered three rare train eggs near the abandoned **Whistlestop Yards** and wants you to choose one as your first partner train. Little do you know, your childhood rival **Blake** is also being invited...
