## Technical Implementation Details

### Intro Sequence Flow
1. Player presses Enter/A on title screen
2. Game creates new Player instance and IntroScene
3. Game transitions to INTRO state
4. IntroScene displays 7 dialogue boxes about Locomotia, trains, and grandfather's legacy
5. Player advances with A button
6. When intro complete, game creates StarterSelection and transitions to STARTER_SELECTION state

### Starter Selection Flow

#### Phase 1: Pre-Selection Dialogue
- StarterSelection starts in 'intro' phase
- Displays 3 dialogue boxes from Professor Cypress
- Player advances with A button
- After final dialogue, phase changes to 'selection'

#### Phase 2: Selection
- Displays 3 train eggs in horizontal layout
- Each egg is color-coded by type:
  - STEAM (Steamini): #8B5A3C (warm brown)
  - ELECTRIC (Sparkart): #FFE55C (electric yellow)
  - DIESEL (Diesling): #5C4428 (chocolate brown)
- Selected egg has golden highlight and thicker border
- Description box updates dynamically as player navigates
- Left/Right arrows or touch to navigate
- A button to confirm selection
- On confirmation:
  - Creates Train instance at level 5
  - Adds train to player's party
  - Gives player 5 Trainballs and 2 Potions
  - Transitions to 'post-selection' phase

#### Phase 3: Post-Selection
- Displays 10 dialogue boxes
- First dialogue is choice-based (different for each starter)
- Includes item distribution notification
- Final dialogue sends player on their journey
- After completion, game transitions to OVERWORLD state

## Item Distribution

Upon starter selection, player receives:
- **5 Trainballs** (`player.items.pokeball = 5`)
- **2 Potions** (`player.items.potion = 2`)

Note: The internal item key is `pokeball` but referenced as "Trainballs" in dialogue for thematic consistency.

---

## Mobile Support

The implementation fully supports mobile touch controls:
- **D-Pad Left/Right:** Navigate between starters
- **A Button (or tap):** Advance dialogue / Confirm selection
- **Touch target considerations:** All interactive elements meet 60x60px minimum
- All dialogue boxes use the existing mobile-friendly DialogueBox class

---

## Save/Load Compatibility

The implementation preserves game state through save/load:
- `player.hasStarterTrain` flag set after selection
- `player.metProfessor` flag set after selection
- Player's party includes selected starter train
- Items (Trainballs, Potions) are saved in player.items
- All flags saved in `Player.toJSON()` and restored in `Player.fromJSON()`

---

## Known Limitations / Future Enhancements
