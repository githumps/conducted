## Project Overview

**CONDUCTED** is a pixel-perfect replica of Pokemon Red/Blue using trains instead of Pokemon. The game features:
- 151 unique train species (already defined in `js/train-data.js`)
- Classic turn-based battle system with Gen 1 damage calculations
- 8 train types with type advantages (Steam, Electric, Diesel, Maglev, Freight, Passenger, Nuclear, Monorail)
- Mobile-first design with touch controls
- Complete story campaign with 8 gym leaders, rival battles, and Team Steam Punk storyline
- Full worldbuilding and character dialogue documented in `WORLDBUILDING.md` and `STORY.md`

### Recent Victory
✅ **Building entry bug (#12) fixed** - Players can now enter and exit buildings correctly

### Current State
- Basic battle system exists but incomplete (no PP, status conditions, party switching)
- World map has limited areas (mostly Piston Town)
- Save/load works but needs expansion for new features
- All 151 trains defined with stats, moves, and evolution data
- Complete narrative content written and ready to implement

---

## Development Philosophy

### Make Each Milestone Independently Playable
Each milestone should result in a game that:
1. Can be played from start to current endpoint
2. Doesn't crash or soft-lock
3. Provides a complete (if limited) experience

### Bite-Sized Coding Tasks
Issues are designed to be:
- Completable in 1-4 hours for most features
- Clearly scoped with acceptance criteria
- Minimal external dependencies where possible

### Mobile-First, Desktop-Compatible
- Touch controls are already implemented
- All new UI must work on mobile screens
- Keyboard controls remain fully functional

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checkpoints
After each major feature, test:
1. **Save/Load:** Does the feature persist correctly?
2. **Mobile:** Does it work on touch controls?

4. **Integration:** Does it break existing features?

### Milestone Testing
Before marking a milestone complete:
1. Play through all content from scratch
2. Test save/load at 5+ different points
3. Verify mobile controls work for all new UI
4. Confirm no soft-locks or crashes
5. Check performance on lower-end devices

### Automated Testing (#39)

- Map navigation tests
- Battle victory/defeat tests
- Save/load serialization tests
- Wild encounter triggering tests

## FAQ

**Q: Can I work on Milestone 5 features now?**
A: Not recommended. Focus on M1 first to get a playable game.

**Q: What if I find a bug not in the issue list?**
A: Create a new issue with `P0-critical` label if game-breaking, otherwise add to appropriate milestone.

**Q: How accurate to Pokemon Red/Blue should this be?**
A: Mechanics should match Gen 1 exactly. Theming and content are train-themed variations.

**Q: Can I change the art style?**
A: Follow `ART_DIRECTION_SPECS.md` guidelines. Propose changes via issue discussion first.

**Q: What about Pokemon mechanics from later generations?**
A: Defer to post-launch. This is explicitly a Gen 1 replica.
