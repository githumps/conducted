# Claude Code Session Instructions for CONDUCTED

> **CRITICAL**: Read this file at the start of EVERY session to maintain coherence and keep context lean

## üìç Project Context

**CONDUCTED** is a browser-based train battle RPG - a Pokemon Red/Blue replica where you catch, train, and battle trains instead of Pokemon. Built with pure JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas, no framework, mobile-optimized with touch controls.

**Repository**: `/Users/evan/Documents/GitHub/conducted`
**GitHub**: https://github.com/githumps/conducted
**Live Demo**: https://githumps.github.io/conducted/

## üéØ Current Mission

**Goal**: Ship Milestone 1 MVP - A complete playable loop from Piston Town to Victory Rail

**Status**: ~40% complete - Game boots and basics work, but CRITICAL systems missing

**Blocking Issues** (must fix first):
- **#52** (P0) - Map transitions broken, can't enter some buildings
- **#51** (P1) - No item system (potions, trainballs)
- **#53** (P1) - No money/currency system
- **#49** (P1) - No trainer NPC battles yet

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HARD CONSTRAINTS (Never Break These)

### 1. Context Budget: Target <8,000 tokens per turn
- **Never paste full files** - use file paths + line ranges only
- Quote max 30 lines of code at a time
- Summarize long reasoning into DOCS/TASKLOG.md
- If response exceeds 1,800 tokens, hooks will auto-dump to TASKLOG

### 2. Memory Offloading: GitHub Issues are Your Long-Term Memory
- Every bug/feature MUST have a GitHub issue before coding
- Design decisions ‚Üí GitHub issue comments
- Roadmap/planning ‚Üí `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` (already exists)
- Session notes ‚Üí `DOCS/TASKLOG.md` (create with ISO timestamps)

### 3. Small Steps Only
- Max 150 lines changed per PR
- If larger, hooks will force a split plan
- Green builds only - broken tests block merge
- One issue per PR, link with "Fixes #N"

### 4. Issue-First Development
- Check existing 59 issues before creating new ones
- Use labels: `P0-critical`, `P1-high`, `P2-medium`, `P3-low`
- Use milestones: `milestone-1` through `milestone-6`
- Reference issues by number: `#52`, not descriptions

## üóÇÔ∏è Codebase Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: Pure JavaScript (ES6+), no TypeScript, no build step
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas 2D context (1280x720 logical pixels)
- **State**: Object-oriented with game loop at 60 FPS
- **Storage**: localStorage for saves (with export/import tokens)
- **Mobile**: Touch D-Pad + A/B buttons, works on phones/tablets
- **Deploy**: GitHub Pages, auto-deploys from `main` branch

### Key Files You'll Touch Often
- `js/game.js` (lines 284-300) - Door transition logic
- `js/world-maps.js` - Map definitions + door placements
- `js/player.js` - Inventory, money, party management
- `js/battle.js` - Battle loop, damage calc, rewards
- `js/ui.js` - Menus, HUD, item selection
- `js/train-data.js` - Train stats (READ ONLY - don't change!)

## üèóÔ∏è What's Already Built (Don't Reinvent)

### ‚úÖ Complete Systems
- **All 151 trains defined** in `train-data.js` (names, types, stats, evolutions)
- **All moves defined** in `moves.js` (power, accuracy, PP, type)
- **Battle system works** - Gen 1 damage formula, type chart, STAB, criticals
- **Level-up & evolution** - XP curves, evolution triggers
- **Save/load** - localStorage + export/import tokens
- **Touch controls** - Mobile D-Pad already implemented
- **Traindex viewer** - Pok√©dex equivalent, shows all trains
- **Starter selection** - Professor Cypress intro scene

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Built (Needs Completion)
- **Overworld** - Piston Town & Coal Harbor exist, Route 1 partial
- **Menus** - Pause menu exists but incomplete
- **NPCs** - Dialogue system works, but few trainers implemented

### ‚ùå Missing / Broken (Your Focus)
- **Items** - No potions, trainballs, repels, etc. (#51)
- **Money** - No currency system (#53)
- **Trainer battles** - Can't fight NPCs yet (#49)
- **Healing** - Train Depot doesn't work (#23)
- **Shopping** - Rail Mart doesn't work (#24)
- **Map transitions** - Some doors broken (#52)
- **Capture** - Can't catch wild trains (#27)
- **Gym battles** - No station masters yet (#33)

## üìã Development Workflow

### Starting a Session
1. **Load the right agent** (see `.claude/agents/`)
   - Enforcer PM ‚Üí for roadmap/planning/issue triage
   - Gameplay Engineer ‚Üí for battles/XP/evolution/items
   - World Engineer ‚Üí for maps/doors/collision/encounters
   - UI Engineer ‚Üí for menus/HUD/touch controls
   - QA Engineer ‚Üí for tests/CI/bugs

2. **Check Milestone 1 status**: Run `/milestone1` command

3. **Pick ONE issue** from critical path, read its full description

4. **Post your plan** before coding:
   ```
   **Goal**: (1 sentence)
   **Plan**: (3-5 bullets)
   **Files**: (paths only)
   **Tests**: (what you'll test)
   **Risks**: (what could break)
   ```

### While Working
- **Reference files by path + lines**, not by pasting code
- **Test on mobile** after every UI change (touch controls!)
- **Run `npm run lint`** before committing (if you add lint scripts)
- **Check for save-load bugs** - always test saves work
- **Deterministic randomness** - use seeded RNG for testing

### Before Merging
- [ ] Tests pass (if tests exist)
- [ ] Lint clean (if lint configured)
- [ ] Mobile controls tested
- [ ] Save/load tested
- [ ] Issue closed with "Fixes #N"
- [ ] Context dumped to TASKLOG.md if session was long

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't break existing saves** - localStorage schema is sacred
2. **Don't change train stats** - 151 trains already balanced
3. **Don't remove mobile controls** - touch D-Pad must always work
4. **Don't paste huge files** - use line ranges + diffs only
5. **Don't skip GitHub issues** - memory offloading is mandatory
6. **Don't make giant PRs** - max 150 lines, hooks will block larger
7. **Don't ignore the roadmap** - DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md is your guide

## ü§ñ Agent Handoff Protocol

If you realize you're the wrong agent for the task:

1. Stop immediately
2. Summarize what you learned (max 100 tokens)
3. Post to DOCS/TASKLOG.md with ISO timestamp
4. Create/update the relevant GitHub issue
5. State which agent should take over (Enforcer PM / Gameplay / World / UI / QA)

**Do NOT try to do work outside your specialty** - handoffs keep context lean.

---

## üìû Emergency Context Reset

If context exceeds 8k tokens or you're confused:

1. Dump everything to `DOCS/TASKLOG.md` with ISO timestamp
2. Create a GitHub issue titled "Context Overflow - [topic]" with summary label
3. Close the current chat
4. Start fresh with Enforcer PM agent
5. Reference the new issue number to continue
