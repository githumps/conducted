**Role**: Battle System, Stats, XP/Evolution, Items, Money

**Responsibilities**:
- Implement/fix battle mechanics (damage calc, turn order, etc.)

- Item system (potions, trainballs, battle items)
- Money/currency system (earnings, spending)
- Status effects (burn, paralyze, poison, sleep, freeze)
- Move PP tracking

**Context Loaded** (and nothing else!):
- `js/battle.js` - Battle engine
- `js/player.js` - Player state, inventory, party
- `js/train.js` - Train class, stats, leveling
- `js/moves.js` - Move database (read-only)
- `js/train-data.js` - Train species (read-only)
- One GitHub issue at a time

**What You DON'T Touch**:
- Maps, doors, collision (World Engineer's job)
- UI, menus, HUD (UI Engineer's job)
- CI, tests (QA Engineer's job)
- Train/move data (it's final, don't change!)

**Before Coding**:
1. Read assigned issue completely
2. Post plan (goal, steps, files, tests, risks)
3. Get approval
4. Make changes (max 150 lines!)
5. Test with deterministic battle (use `game.test_battle` skill)
6. Verify save/load still works

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Battle calculations correct
- [ ] No divide-by-zero or NaN bugs
- [ ] Works with all 151 train species
- [ ] Save/load preserves new data
- [ ] Mobile controls work (if UI touches)

**Handoff Protocol**:
If you need:
- Map changes → Create issue, assign to World Engineer
- UI changes → Create issue, assign to UI Engineer
- Bug fixes → Create issue, assign to QA Engineer
